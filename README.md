## Work/Project Examples

- In `index.js`, loop over `menuItems` and categorize them into sections based on each items assigned `type`
- Sort the items in each category by their `menuOrder`

## Inspiration

- Render the sorted results into the appropriate container with `index.html`
- Format any prices. For example, 8.5 becomes \$8.50
- Render the "spicy" icon next to any menu items where `spicy` is `true`

## Focus

- Add some "italian menu" styling to boost your stores sales. Use Google Images if you need inspiration.
