## Work/Project Examples
Provide up to three examples of work/projects that you’ve recently participated in and provide detailed information about your role and contributions to the project.

1. SCHEM∆

Live: https://schema-project.herokuapp.com/

Github: https://github.com/MrMcPat/schema

This project's goal was to create a video and streaming platform for people that are interested in software/game development and to allow users to also stream their own content. I have worked with another person in this project. My partner and I did not have a specific role, but I mostly handled the back-end of the application, including user authentication, user settings, and managing the databases with Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL. The project was primarily done with a pair programming approach where both my partner and I alternate between driving and navigating.

2. Weather or Not

Live: https://mrmcpat.github.io/Weather-Or-Not/

Github: https://github.com/MrMcPat/Weather-Or-Not

Weather or Not is a simple front-end weather application made with vanilla JavaScript which includes a minimalist user interface that displays a 7 day forecast that alerts the user if they may need an umbrella or not. This project was also my first time collaborating with other person and also one of the first projects I have done in web development. My role was to handle the HTML/CSS and to utilize JavaScript with CSS to create immersive animations and styling that can keep the user engaged. My partner would handle the external API data to display the weather details onto the webpage.

3. Brain Fumble

Live: https://mrmcpat.github.io/fumble-game/#/

Github: https://github.com/MrMcPat/fumble-game

This project is a lighthearted series of minigames used to test the user's memory and visual capabilities. I have worked another person in this project. My role in the project was to create the user interface and the functionality of the minigames whereas my partner handled the leaderboards and the back-end to have the highscores saved in the database. However, even with our roles, we do take over each others roles occasionally so both of us can get exposure on building fullstack applications. This project was a bit different from the usual projects where there are some reliance on external APIs as it allowed me to think outside the box to create the functionality needed for the games to work. This was also the first project that gave me hands on experience on back-end development with Ruby as we used a lightweight back-end framework called Sinatra.

## Inspiration

Provide up to three examples of work that has recently inspired you from a technical perspective. These can be open source projects, CodePens/CodeSandboxes, blog posts, etc. Be sure to include specifics on what you found inspiring.

1. Allegro

Github: https://github.com/MrMcPat/allegro

For the longest time, I had a goal to dabble into mobile development. After getting familiar with React, I was extremely curious to learn and try React Native as it supports both iOs and Android. The syntax and the nature of React Native is very similar to React so I can also use what I have learned before. The project's goal was to create a sleep pattern adjustment system for the user's to correct their sleep patterns. This project allowed me to learn numerous key differences of mobile apps compared to web apps. For instance, routing in web apps vs navigation in mobile apps (such as stack navigation and tab navigation).

2. Adagio

Live: https://adagio-app.herokuapp.com/

Github: https://github.com/MrMcPat/adagio

Adagio gave me the opportunity to work on a fullstack application independently, whereas previously I have worked in pairs with others. Although looking back, the goal of the project was not to learn a new technology as I was already familiar with the technologies used in the project. The goal was to solidify my knowledge on the technologies and to tie any loose ends. Ultimately, I had learned of many issues I may come across in the future, such as the importance of user experience, CORS policy with browsers, external API calls through the back-end rather than through the front-end, and how to manage many relational database tables.

3. SCHEM∆

Live: https://schema-project.herokuapp.com/

Github: https://github.com/MrMcPat/schema

This project allowed me to step out of my comfort zone to implement real time streaming functionality. Streaming follows a protocol called RTMP (Real-Time Messaging Protocol) and was able to do extensive research to find an external API that allows RTMP. This also taught me the importance of reading documentation of any API or technology.

## Focus

If you were given the time and resources to build/learn anything you wanted during your first 6 months at CM, where would you choose to focus your efforts? Provide a brief description of how you would spend your time.

There are a few things I would like to learn if I were given the time and resources during my first 6 months at CM:

-Working with others: Although I have worked with others in the past in projects, I have never worked in web development in a professional team setting. I want to learn how to effectively communicate with other developers.

-User experience: I would focus more on learning how to design and develop effective user experiences. I believe that user experience is essential for the success of any project/application. I have realized eventhough I know how to utilize CSS and Javascript/React to create UIs, user experience or UX is something that I personally find to be very abstract and hard to understand at times. While these are not required to create stunning UIs and top notch user experience, I would dabble more into SCSS and perhaps tailwind CSS which can help manage and organize CSS in the application.

-Front-end libraries and technologies: Aside from building beautiful user experience, I would also like to spend my time diving deeper into React and the extensive amount of libraries out there. Recently I have been learning Redux and TypeScript. I recently implemented Redux into a side project just to get some hands-on experience on that. The goal here is to learn best practices when building out applications especially in large scale applications.
